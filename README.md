# PkmnAdventure
Games Week Project

A project made through the course of a week with classmates from the <Academia_de_CÃ³digo> Bootcamp, near the beggining of said Bootcamp.
It features characters from pokemon traversing a maze, with collision detection and checks to see if the correct character is going through the
color coded walls.

This project was then uploaded to itch.io with the projects made by the other teams - you can find it at:
